# Accessibility Testing with Cypress

Cypress is a great tool for integration or end-to-end testing for accessibility. You can load whole pages in a real browser and assert user flows are accessible from the keyboard. You can also test for programatic states similar to how a user would experience the site.

To start Cypress for integration testing, run this command:

```
yarn test:e2e
```
